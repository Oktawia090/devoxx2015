# Predicting the Future with Machine Learning

## Links
* project Oxford: http://www.projectoxford.ai
  * portfolio of REST APIs and SDKs for ML (e.g., vision APIs, face APIs, speech APIs, language understanding, emotion API, spell check API, ...)

## Machine learning
Computing systems becoming smarter with experience:
* Experience = past data + human input

Mass of data

Types:
* supervised machine learning: we have the data and the right answer
* unsupervised

## Why now
* cloud computing wide availability
* lots of data available
* agility and the need to develop quickly

## Azure machine learning
* Data: blobs and tables, hadoop (hdinsight), relational db (azure SQL DB)
* IDE for machine learning: ML Studio
* API: model is now a web service
* Monetize the API through the marketplace
* Clients interact with the API and the market

## Machine Learning Process Model
* idea: question that'll be useful
* data
* business knowledge <-> data understanding
* data preparation
* modelling
* evaluation
* publish

## Example
